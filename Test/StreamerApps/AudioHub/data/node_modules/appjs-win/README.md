AppJS is an SDK to develop desktop applications using node. Or at least
it is going to be!

The goal is to facilitate native app development using
tools every developer is familiar with nowadays: HTML/CSS/JS

## How to use

This is ready to use AppJS module. It contains everything you need to build and test
your application.
